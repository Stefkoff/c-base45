# Base45 encoding and decoding

Thi code is implementation of RFC 9285 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9285) in C.
I didn't checked other repositories for similar implementation, because I wanted to do it myself.
Not sure if it is good or bad, but it works.

## Dependencies
* CMake
## Build
* mkdir build
* cd build
